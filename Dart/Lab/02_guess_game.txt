Now let us make the guess game program a little bit more interesting 😁️.

If you have completed Activity 13, you must have realized that you need to hardcode your guess number into the source code anytime you want to make a guess
and that the program exits whether or not the guess was correct.

And also, because everytime the program runs, a new random number is generated every point in time, it makes it impossible to guess the previous random number the next 
time you re-run the program.

We believe you are the best person for the job😁️, and we want you to make an update to our game. Such that:
1. The user does not have to fiddle with the souce code to make a guess.
2. Once our program runs, we don't want it to stop till the random number has been guessed correctly.
3. We would love to know the number of attempts a user made before he guessed the correct random number that was generated.
