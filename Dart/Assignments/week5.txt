>> ACTIVITY 9
Write a program that can collect a students' exam score and then display the corresponding grade.

For example
If the user input is:
-greater than 69 but less than and equal to 100, print to the console, "you scored an A"
-greater than 59 but less than 70, print to the console, "you scored a B"
-greater than and equal to 50 but less than 60, print to the console, "you scored a C"
-greater than 44 but less than 50, print to the console, "you scored a D"
-else, print to the console, "you scored an F"

E.G
What's the total you scored?
INPUT: 72
OUTPUT: you scored an A

What's the total you scored?
INPUT: 52
OUTPUT: you scored an C



>> ACTIVITY 10
Create a CGPA calculator program that the user can input his CGPA point as a decimal and the program will display the students' class of degree.

4.50-5.00 >> 1st class
3.50-4.49 >> 2nd class upper
2.40-3.49 >> 2nd class lower
1.50-2.39 >> 3rd class
1.00-1.49 >> Pass
Less than 1.00 >> Fail

For example:
INPUT: 4.2
OUTPUT: 2nd class upper



>> ACTIVITY 11
Write a code to generate the 2’s Multiplication table in this structure
2*1 = 2
2*2 = 4
.
.
.
2*10 = 10;



>> ACTIVITY 12
Define a function “greet” that prints “Hello `name`, welcome to Deebug”. Where name is the argument that was passed as a parameter to the greet function.


>> ACTIVITY 13
Create a function that generates a random number in the range (0-10). And then your program should check if the number you guessed is higher, lower or if the number matches the random number that was generated
Once you are done with the function definition, call the function and pass your guessed number as an argument to the function and then run your program

EXAMPLE
Assuming the guessGame function has been defined already and i call my function by typing
guessGame(4);

If the random number that was generated when this program ran was 5, it should print to the console: Your guess is too low
if the random number that was generated when the program ran was 3, it should print to the console: Your guess is too high
if the random number that was generated when the program ran was 5, it should print: Congrats! Your guess is correct!
