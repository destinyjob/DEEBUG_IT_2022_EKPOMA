else:
Your program should ask next for the users type of pizza he/she wants
>>if the user does not select a valid option from 1 to 7, it should keep asking the user to select a valid input

Your program should ask if the user wants toppings
and if the user selects y, the program should ask for the type of toppings he/she wants

And then finally, the program should ask the user for name, phone number and address and then display the receipt for the order.
