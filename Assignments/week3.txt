>> Activity 1
Write a program to check if the value of a variable is an even number or not


>> Activity 2
You have just finished building a physics calculator app for a client.
One of the features of this calculator is to solve for Acceleration using this formula:
Force = Mass x Acceleration.
Now, let us test if it works as the client would want it.
Given:
Force = 25.5N
Mass = 10.2kg
Write an algorithm to solve for acceleration.
NOTE: Ensure that the final result is an integer whole number


>> Activity 3
Write a program to collect 3 different numbers from the user and print the greatest among the three
