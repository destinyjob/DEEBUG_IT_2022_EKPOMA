DART VARIABLE NAMING RULES
1. Names must begin with a letter and can also begin with $ and _
2. Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. All other special characters are not allowed.
3. Variable names can’t contain spaces.
4. Every language has reserved keywords that cannot be used in variable names, and dart is not exempt from this rule. For example; int is a keyword which means Integer already to the computer. You cannot declare a variable and specify its name to be int. That simply would not work.
