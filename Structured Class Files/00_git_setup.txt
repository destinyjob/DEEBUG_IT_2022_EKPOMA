>> TO SETUP GIT AND PUSH A PROJECT FOR THE FIRST TIME

Ensure you are on git version 2.28 and above

If you enable readMeFile when creating the remote repo, you might have issues when pushing your project to that repo

When you create a new remote project, it will by default be set to master as the default project branch whereas your remote repo might be set to main and this might cause issues.
So to configure the initial branch name to use main in all of your new repositories, run in terminal
>> git config --global init.defaultBranch main

The global git username and email address are associated with commits on all repositories on your system
So to set your Git username and email for every repository on your computer, run
>> git config --global user.name "yourGithubUsername"
>> git config --global user.email "yourGithubEmail"

Then ensure you are in the directory of the project you want to push to your repo and run the following commands
>> git init			//Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one. THIS WILL INITIALIZE THE CURRENT DIRECTORY AS A GIT REPO

>> git status		// THIS WILL HELP YOU TO KNOW IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY TRACKING YOUR MAIN BRANCH OR ANOTHER BRANCH

>> git add .			//stage all files or Adds all file contents to the index

>> git commit -m "first commit to github"		//Record changes to the repository

>> git remote add origin remoteRepoProjectLink

>> git push -u origin main
